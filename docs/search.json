    "text": "My research interests are at the intersection of comparative political economy, political behaviour and communication. My dissertation investigates the governance of emerging economic markets in Central and Eastern European countries, its relationship to state capacity and its impact on economic and political preferences at the individual (civilians and elites) and firm level.\nI am also interested in issues pertaining to identifying and measuring misinformation both from the supply and demand sides in a multi-methods perspective, using quantitative (survey, experimental & causal inference designs), qualitative (interviews, focus-groups, field observations) and approaches at the convergence of both (e.g. natural language processing).\nResearch Projects:\nAuthoritarian Global Foreign Disinformation Strategies: This research, in collaboration with Prof. Jean-Christophe Boucher (University of Calgary) investigates the foreign disinformation strategies of China and Russia on social media platforms (Twitter/X, Telegram, Facebook) in Western and Global South countries. We leverage unsupervised natural language processing (NLP) models to analyze and structure Chinese and Russian strategies and narratives in a data-driven fashion to enable the construction of a theoretical framework of authoritarian foreign disinformation.\nThis research stems from the willingness to use highly strategically-structured and centralized state-disseminated (dis)information to make sense of the much broader complex ecosystem of authoritarian disinformation.\nCross-Country Diaspora Survey Matching: This research seeks to build a survey-experimental design on the media consumption practices of Chinese, Russian and Indian diasporas living in the United States and Canada. The goal is to match these individuals with co-nationals in their home countries to investigate the relationship between media consumption, political preferences and behaviour. This research seeks to promote the use of pre-registration and pre-acceptance publication mechanisms as ways to promote the development of more rigorous research design, research transparency, replicability and incentivize exploratory research by encouraging the publication of null and negative results.\nRussian Emigrants in the Former Soviet Union: Leveraging vignette survey experiment data of Russian citizens living who left Russia to live in other former soviet republics, this study investigates the political preferences and investigates their political preferences. It also explores the determinants most likely to influence their willingness to move back to Russia. This research is part of a broader research program for scholars of the Former Soviet Union and authoritarian regimes who seek to refine their techniques of ethical data collection surrounding political behaviour in authoritatian context.\nWorking Papers:\nDubé D., Boucher J-C, “Whispers from the Kremlin: Inoculating Against Russian Propaganda in the Global South”, Presented at APSA 2024 in Philadelphia.

    "text": "Welcome to my site! I work in comparative political economy, focusing on issues surrounding informal economics, digitization and misinformation in Central, Eastern Europe and Eurasia. I’m interested in the interaction of these issue areas with state capacity, financial and digital literacy. In addition, I have a passion for computational methods, measurement challenges and the operationalization of natural language processing and machine learning models to issues of political science, notably misinformation.\nI am affiliated with the Centre for International Peace and Security Studies and I am a member of the Democracy, Transparency, Information Provision, and Participation lab, led by Prof. Aaron Erlich, a research lab affiliated with the Centre for the Study of Democracy and Citizenship in the Department of Political Science at McGill University.\nOutside academia, I enjoy cycling, being an occasional musician, as well as immersing myself in the complex art-science of baking."

My dissertation investigates the governance of emerging economic markets in Central and Eastern European countries, its relationship to state capacity and its impact on economic and political preferences at the individual and firm level.\nI am also interested in issues pertaining to identifying and measuring misinformation both from the supply and demand sides in a multi-methods perspective. My research projects and academic training have led me to acquire methodological training in quantitative (survey, experimental & causal inference designs), and qualitative methods (interviews, focus-groups, field observations) as well as approaches mobilizing both, such as natural language processing.\nPreviously, I completed a Master’s degree in Political Science and International Relations at the University of Quebec at Montreal, where my dissertation on the construction of Russia’s revanchist identity and the annexation of Crimea obtained a mention of excellence by the Jury.\nBeyond of Political Science, I’m fond of data science, astrophysics and linguistics.\nOutside of academia, I’m an avid fan of cycling, botany and a weekend trumpeter.\nCV:\n\nThis browser does not support PDFs.
